                 <p1 class="artist_story">"I feel that tattooing is way more than a job, I found a passion for life."<br>
                   <span class="more"><br> I am Anders Østergaard and I come from Vejen, Southern Denmark, but I grew up in Århus.
                    My love for drawing started at a young age and has developed over the years. I got my first tattoo – a small black dragonfly when I was 18. The design was made by me. From that time, I became truly inspired with the tattoo art and I knew I want to become a tattoo artist.<br><br><span class="anders-subheaders">The dream came true</span><br><br>
                    Years later, in 2010, I met Mark who at that time started his own tattoo shop “Sinners Ink”. He offered to teach me, and I took this opportunity. I learned a lot from him about the world of tattooing and the different techniques and my dream slowly starts to take shape. I’m still in contact with my teacher and also attend tattoo conventions and seminars as well as daily contact with other artists. I gained a lot of valuable hands-on experience and the time spent there was very rewarding.<br><br>

                    After that, I started tattooing friends and that quickly grew into something bigger. My friends spread a good word of mouth and more people who want to be tattooed came to me. I became more and more experienced and confident in my skills. That’s how my dream came true and Flying Needles Tattoo was born.<br><br>

                    Now, I spend almost all my time drawing and tattooing. For me personally, the art will always come first, I see myself as an artist and not just as a tattoo artist. What is very important for me is the relationship of trust I have with my clients and creating the best piece of art for them.<br><br>
                    <span class="anders-subheaders">My style</span><br><br>

                    Tattoo art nowadays holds a wide range of different styles. However, I quickly fell in love with the style called “Black'n'Grey”, which reminds me of the pencil drawings I've always done throughout my childhood. I also have chosen to decorate my own body in this style.
                    I love working as a tattoo artist and I always do my absolute best to deliver the best possible result to any of my clients. It's a creative and collaborative process and it’s important to work together with them. I need to have a greater understanding of their vision and transform it into a special and unique tattoo design.

                    It’s an honour and pleasure to design and make tattoos.
